% Introduction  / strengths
With research experience in modeling complex geometries and developing
software for radiation transport simulation and analysis, I believe I am
well-suited for the R\&D Engineer 2  position in W-13
%, IRC57826,
at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
For your consideration, I have submitted a full r\'{e}sum\'{e}, summary of my thesis research, and
the following summary of skills and
experience relevant to this position. \\

	       \item Involved in several analysis projects
		      [Pubs. \ref{nair}, \ref{aries}]	       
			       that require the hand calculation of material compositions
			     and geometric quantities to support complex Monte
			      Carlo radiation transport simulations

% Introduction  / strengths
With research experience in modeling complex geometries and developing
software for radiation transport simulation and analysis, I believe I am
well-suited for the Engineering Analyst position in W-13, IRC57826,
at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
For your consideration, I have submitted a full r\'{e}sum\'{e} along with
the following summary of my skills and
experience relevant to this position.

%Below is a summary of my knowledge and skills relevant to this position: \vspace{1mm}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=.9in,rightmargin=.875in,itemsep=1.6mm]

%\item Programming experience using Python, Matlab, and C/C++ for a variety of physics and data analysis applications
%\item Nine years working on Unix and Linux operating systems, such as Red Hat
%\item Experience running simulations using the high-performance computing systems at LANL
%\item Strong desire in continuing a career at LANL focused on weapons systems and national security issues
%\item Developed models and performed radiation transport simulations in \textsc{MCNP}, and cross-validated results with experimental data
%\item Familiarity with multi-physics analysis of nuclear weapons and working with Q-level sensitive material
%\item Effective at communicating results on advanced scientific topics, demonstrated through a history of writing publications and presenting at conferences
%\item Fourier Analysis for reconstruction of 
%\item Experienced with several physics-based codes, including radiation transport in \textsc{MCNP} and finite-element modeling and development in Abaqus/CAE
%\item Multiple years of experience with the high-performance computing systems at LANL
%\item Strong willingness to learn new skills, further my education, and excel in my current area of research 
                \item Over six years of experience with MCNP analysis of
			mesh-based geometries of complex nuclear
	              systems including the ARIES-ACT2 fusion energy device refXXX,
		      computational human phantoms in space radiaiton environments
		      refXXX, weapons systems reflacp, and materials testing
		      experiments in the
		      Annular Core Research Reactor (ACRR)
                \item Participated in weekly project meetings with external collaborators (NASA and
	              ITER) to develop timelines, review preliminary results, and discuss
		      solutions to technical challenges
		\item Spent several months working alongside a researcher
			Performed MCNP calculations
			at LANL's Ion Beam Materials Laboratory
			on beamline validation experiments as well as
			visiting ACRR to interface with engineers performing
			materials testing
		\item Have written formal reports to summarize project
			deliverables to external customers as well as conference
			papers and presentations to clearly demonstrate
			utility of software
			developments and analysis results
		\item Effective member of research teams at LANL and
			UW, brainstorming approaches to problems, dividing the
			work, and then independently fulfilling my duties to the teams and
			customers by ensuring timely execution of deliverables
		\item  Have worked for LANL in support of DOE missions and am
			currently funded by the DOE Office of Fusion Energy
			developing analysis tools to support the ITER project 
		\item I look forward to the opportunity to travel to
			conferences and meetings to network with other
			scientists, promote our technical
			findings, and expand my knowledge
               \item Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering, Master's degree
		       and future Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering
	       \item Graduate research has revolved around the development of
		       computational tools for Monte Carlo analysis,
		       particularly in parallel computing environments.  My
		       thesis work involves automated variance reduction for
		       coupled multi-physics processes occuring in dynamic, complex
		       systems.
	       \item Involved in several analysis projects (ref lanl
			       nair and aries) that require
			      hand calculations to support complex Monte
			      Carlo radiation transport simulations
	       \item LANL UGA project centered around validation and
		       verification of the MCNP6 unstructured mesh
		       capability ref uga presentation
	       \item Experience writing scripts to parse MCNP output
	               and plot results as well as writing scripts to
		       prepare mesh geometries for use with DAGMC
		       radiation transport simulations
	       \item Use conferences and meetings as a means to lead
		       discussions with current and potential customers about
		       the software that my team and I have developed
              \item Held DOE Q-level security clearance from Sept. 2011 to July
		      2012. Paperwork submitted February 2017 for
		      reinvestigation.
